# Welcome to Deep RL Course!

Welcome to the Spring 2025 offering of the Deep Reinforcement Learning course at Sharif University of Technology! This week, we aim to introduce you to the exciting world of Reinforcement Learning. We've planned an engaging and informative week filled with lectures, hands-on sessions, and fun activities to get you started on your RL journey!

## Lectures

Get ready for [two exciting lectures](/lectures/week1) that will introduce you to the fundamentals of RL.

To kick things off, we recommend watching this award-winning documentary before class:

And don't miss this talk on the history of reinforcement learning by Professor Andrew Barto himself:

## Recitation

We have a [recitation session](/recitations/week1/) where we will go through the lecture content with clarifying examples.

## Workshop

Join us for a fun [workshop session](/workshops/week1/) where we will get hands-on and implement most of the important ideas covered in the lectures and more!

## Homework

We've designed a fun homework assignment for you! You'll model some interesting problems in RL and solve them using the StableBaseline framework.

## Guest Lecture

We also have a very exciting and surprising guest for this week that we will announce tomorrow!

Wish you all the best for this semester!
