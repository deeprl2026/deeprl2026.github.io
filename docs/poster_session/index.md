# Introduction

The purpose of the poster session is for you to dive into a reinforcement learning topic of your choice, enjoy the learning process, and share your enthusiasm with classmates and the wider community! This is your chance to explore something that excites you—whether it's a cutting-edge algorithm, a unique application, or an open research question—and present it in a way that sparks curiosity. So, have fun, keep experimenting, and let your passion shine through!

# Research Topic Proposal

Before you begin designing your poster, please submit a concise proposal outlining your chosen reinforcement learning topic. This ensures that all submissions maintain high-quality standards and helps you focus your research effectively.

- **Template:** Use the [Proposal Template](https://github.com/DeepRLCourse/Poster-Proposal-Template) to structure your submission.  
- **Submission:** Upload your completed proposal to Quera ([submit here](https://quera.org/course/add_to_course/course/20598/)) by **June 6**.


# Main Grading Components

Your final grade will be determined by three core components: a video presentation, the poster design itself, and an in-person presentation.

---

## Video Presentation (0.3 points)

Record a **Full HD video (1920×1080)** presenting your final work to someone who has basic knowledge of reinforcement learning. Think of this as a mini-lecture or demo that summarizes your project:

- **Submission:** Upload your video to Google Drive and share the link on Quera ([submit here](https://quera.org/course/add_to_course/course/20598/)) by **June 24**.
- **Objective:** Provide a concise, engaging overview of your research so that someone can grasp the core ideas in under 12 minutes.

### Full Marks Criteria
- **Clear Motivation & Context:**  
  Start with “Why does this topic matter?” Give a brief intro to the problem you tackled.
- **Well-Structured Flow:**  
    1. **Introduction** (30–60 seconds): State the problem and why it's interesting.  
    2. **Main Idea / Methods** (4–6 minutes): Describe your approach, algorithmic insights, or experimental setup.  
    3. **Results & Discussion** (2–3 minutes): Highlight key findings—charts, figures, or demo clips.  
    4. **Conclusion & Future Work** (1–2 minutes): Summarize takeaways and possible next steps.
- **Strong Visuals:**  
    - Use slides or screen-sharing to show your poster, code snippets, plots, or demos.  
    - Keep text minimal—focus on diagrams, animations, or short bullet points.  
- **Time Management:**  
    - Aim for **8–12 minutes total**. Practice so you don't rush or run overtime.
- **Engaging Delivery:**  
    - Be audible and clear—consider using a good microphone or quiet environment.  
    - Maintain an energetic pace; avoid monotone speaking.  
    - Make eye contact (if on camera) and use natural gestures to keep viewers engaged.

> **Note:** Since your final video will be featured on our YouTube channel, begin with an introductory slide that prominently displays your name, topic, and affiliation. Also, include your online contact details (e.g., website, social media profiles) in the text file containing your video link, so that we can share them under your video presentation and viewers can easily connect with you.

## Poster Design (0.3 points)

Create a **Vertical A1** poster (594 mm × 841 mm) that visually communicates your project. You can submit either: A **vector** file (PDF, SVG, etc.), or A **high-resolution raster** (PNG, TIF) at **≥ 300 DPI**.

- **Submission:** Upload your final poster to Google Drive and share the link on Quera ([submit here](https://quera.org/course/add_to_course/course/20598/)) by **June 24**.
- **Objective:** Use layout, color, and concise text to guide viewers through your research question, methods, and results.

### Full Marks Criteria
1. **Logical Layout:**  
    - Divide the poster into clear sections: Title / Authors, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References.  
    - Follow a top-to-bottom or left-to-right flow so readers can scan easily.
2. **Readable Typography**
3. **Visual Clarity:**  
    - Include diagrams, charts, or screenshots that directly support your narrative.  
    - Keep text boxes and figures aligned and balanced—avoid overcrowding.
4. **Clear Research Question & Motivation:**  
    - At the very top or upper-left, state “What question are we asking?” in a few sentences.
5. **Concise Methods & Results:**  
    - Use bullet points, flowcharts, or algorithm diagrams to explain your approach.  
    - Present key findings using labeled graphs or tables—annotate them so viewers understand at a glance.
6. **Proper Citations & References:**  
    - Include citations in a smaller font at the bottom.  
    - Use a consistent citation style (MLA).
7. **Polish & Professionalism:**  
    - Check for spelling/grammar errors (proofread!).  
    - Choose a clean color palette (2–3 complementary colors).  
    - Leave enough white space so nothing feels cramped.

## In-Person Presentation (0.4 points)

On **June 26 or 27**, you will stand beside your poster at the poster session, discuss your work with judges and peers, and answer their questions live.

- **Objective:** Demonstrate your deep understanding of the topic and communicate it effectively in a face-to-face setting.

### Full Marks Criteria
1. **Confident Explanation:**  
    - Greet viewers with a brief elevator pitch (15–20 seconds): “Hi, I'm \[Name\], and this is my project on \[Topic\]—we explore \[core idea\] because \[why it matters\].”
    - Walk through the poster, pointing at key sections. Avoid reading text verbatim.
2. **Technical Q&A:**  
    - Anticipate common questions:  
        - “Why did you compare these two algorithms?”  
        - “What are the limitations of your approach?”  
    - If you don't know an answer, it's OK to say, “That's a good point—here's how I'd investigate it next.”
3. **Demonstrated RL Foundations:**  
    - Show that you understand the underlying RL concepts (e.g., Markov Decision Processes, reward design, exploration vs. exploitation).  
    - Be ready to discuss alternatives or extensions.
4. **Engaging the Audience:**  
    - Make eye contact, ask rhetorical questions (“Imagine training an agent that…”).  
    - Show enthusiasm—smile and be approachable.
5. **Time Management:**  
    - Each visitor may only have a few minutes—focus on the big picture first, then dive deeper if they ask.
    - Keep your overall “tour” of the poster to about **10 minutes**, then invite questions.

> **Note:** Your final score and rank in the competition will be a weighted combination of judges' evaluations and audience feedback.

# Bonus Grading Components
